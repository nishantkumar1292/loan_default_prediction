# Loan Default Prediction
This repo is part of a project done to estimate credit worthiness of customers using GPS data.

This project was done as an assignment for a company that was into lending space. Primary product was microloans using mobile data. Data was contained in a Postgres DB (the credentials have been masked, but the connections have been provided).

## Sections in the notebook
1. Relevant imports
2. Connection to DB and get data into pandas dataframes
3. EDA done on data to understand it
4. Feature engineering from given data
5. Developing Model (here RandomForest model developed)
6. Create API class to expose model
7. Next steps and ideas to apply on a larger dataset

### Launch using Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nishantkumar1292/loan_default_prediction.git/main?filepath=loan_deafult_code.ipynb)
Sometimes, the github notebook viewer fails and thus I have provided a binder link.
